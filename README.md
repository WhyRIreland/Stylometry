Link to folder containing document corpus for analysis [Document Corpus](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiBNmgc8zgUtgq5o5LM1lkZ0-0fafw?e=Ygiem9)

We will be analysing these documents but not all at once. 

For the first analysis you need to create a folder called corpus in your current working directory. Please add all works by Shakespeare with the exception of Henry VIII (I'll tell you why at the workshop) and all works by Marlowe. 

The rest of the works we will analyse later in the workshop
